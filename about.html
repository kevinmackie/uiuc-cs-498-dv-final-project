  <h1 align="left">About the Visualization</h1>

  <p>The narrative visualization has been built with a hybrid structure and consists of scenes,
    annotations, parameters, and triggers, as described below</p>

  <h2>Hybrid Structure</h2>
  The narrative visualization should follow one of the three hybrid structures: a martini glass,
  an interactive slideshow, or a drill down story.
  <h2>Scenes</h2>
  The scenes follow a template for consistency, follow an order to best convey the
  message.
  <h3>Scene Layout and Visual Structure</h3>
  Discussion of layout and any visual structure of these scenes.
  <h3>Overview of Scenes</h3>
  <p><b>First scene</b> - shows an overview of SCADA cybersecurity research.</p>
  Annotations are used to overlay key security and cybersecurity events onto the graph, to help suggest reasons
  for the pattern of papers and citations.
  <p><b>Second scene</b> - shows research themes and how they have developed over time.</p>
  <p><b>Third scene</b> - shows key authors, institutions, related to the theme of viruses.</p>
  <p><b>Fourth scene</b> - shows the most influential papers related to viruses in SCADA cybersecurity</p>
  <h2>Annotations</h2>
  The annotations should follow a template for visual consistency, should highlight specific data
  items or trends, and the essay should indicate when they are cleared.
  Annotations are used on scene 1 to show salient characteristics in the data:
  <li>Increase in research around 2002</li>
  <li>Increase in citations around 2010</li>
  <li>Decrease in citations around 2013</li>
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  The parameters should be identified in the essay, which should also discuss the states of the
  narrative visualization.
  <h2>Triggers</h2>
  The triggers should also be identified in the essay, in terms of the events and the parameter
  changes they trigger. User interface events should be listed, along with a description of how
  possible user events are communicated to the viewer.
