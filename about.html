  <h1 align="left">About the Visualization</h1>

  <p>The narrative visualization has been built with a hybrid structure and consists of scenes,
    annotations, parameters, and triggers, as described below</p>

  <h2>Hybrid Structure</h2>
  This narrative visualization follows a "martini glass" hybrid structure consisting of three author-drive
  scenes followed by a final scene in which the read is allowed to explore the literature in an open-ended manner.
  <h2>Scenes</h2>
  The three author-driven scenes follow an identical layout to keep the user from becoming confused in the
  transition between scenes. Transition animation is used to both maintain reader engagement and to orient
  the reader during changes between scenes.

  <h3>Scene Layout and Visual Structure</h3>
  <p>Scenes are templated for consistency and arranged to draw attention to the central chart, which is framed by
  a large thematic title and explanatory sidebar. Page buttons and left and right arrows are used to transition
    between scenes (or to jump to a particular scene).</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Annotations</h2>
  Annotations are placed on the chart to highlight key points and trends in the data. They are implemented
  in a visually consistent manner. Annotations appear in the scene to which they relate, and then disappear
  when the user advanced to the next scene to prevent the chart from becoming cluttered and to allow
  focus on the next point in the story.
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  The key parameter during the initial author-drive scenes is the scene number, which determines the title and sidebar
  text and the visible elements on the chart: axes, data items, annotations.
  In the final reader-driven scene, the parameters are:
  - Year axis range
  - Citation range
  - Category

    The parameters should be identified in the essay, which should also discuss the states of the
  narrative visualization.
  <h2>Triggers</h2>
  The triggers should also be identified in the essay, in terms of the events and the parameter
  changes they trigger. User interface events should be listed, along with a description of how
  possible user events are communicated to the viewer.
  - Page load sets up the first scene and "starts" the state machine in the initial state
  - Advancing to the next scene triggers a change in title and sidebar, as well as transition animations and
  annotations to highlight the story being told in that scene
  - Mouse over events on the chart trigger a tooltip showing drill down details
  - Clicking the last chart selects the papers at the point on the graph
  - selected papers are identified by their coordinates (year, citations)
  - Clicking and dragging on the chart filters the axes (year and citations) and is the same as clicking but
  over a wider axis range
  - Mousing over a legend label highlights data in that category (by desaturating and lowering the brightness
  over other data values)
  - Clicking a legend label selects or deselects that category
  -
  - Left and right arrows become enabled depending on state
  - As the scene increments, elements on the page become visible (or invisible), and enabled (or disabled) as appropriate
  to the current state of the visualization
